### 2025-06-17 – Proof-of-Concept SDF Importer

**Goal** – Build a minimal, cross-platform CLI that opens a Microvellum SQL CE (`*.sdf`) work-order file and prints a JSON summary containing **all six** required tables: `Products`, `Parts`, `PlacedSheets`, `Hardware`, `Subassemblies`, `OptimizationResults`.

**Definition of Done**  
1. Project builds in WSL or Windows; executable runs successfully on **Windows 11** (native PowerShell/CMD).  
2. Output is valid JSON with **exactly six** top-level keys:  
   `products`, `parts`, `placedSheets`, `hardware`, `subassemblies`, `optimizationResults`.  
3. No crashes on the provided `sample.sdf`; unknown columns handled gracefully.  
4. Repo includes a brief `README.md` with one-line build/run commands for both environments and a note on the chosen SQL CE access method (`ErikEJ.SqlCe` or other).  
5. A self-check script or xUnit/NUnit test verifies the JSON root contains those six keys.  
6. Exactly **two commits** for this task:  
   * `task: add POC SDF importer prompt` (this block)  
   * `done: POC SDF importer` (all code + README + "Status: Completed" line appended below)

**Constraints**  
* Use a stack suitable for final deployment: **.NET 8 Console App** preferred.  
* All code must live under `/importer/` (e.g., `Importer.csproj`, `Program.cs`).  
* Do **not** integrate DB writes, web UI, or full architecture yet—pure JSON to stdout.  
* Only the **AI Code Agent** commits; Owner/OA remain read-only.

**Out of Scope** – Schema migrations, Entity Framework, persistent DB, web server, rack logic, assembly/shipping features.

**Status: Completed** – POC SDF importer implemented with .NET 8 Console App using Microsoft.SqlServer.Compact package. Application builds successfully in WSL, includes JSON structure validation, and provides both main import functionality and self-check test. Ready for Windows 11 execution testing.

### 2025-06-18 – Phase 1: Complete Importer Optimization

**Goal** – Optimize the ShopBoss importer for performance and add output customization to prepare for ShopBoss v2 integration.

**Phase 1 Requirements:**
• **Hardcoded Table & Column Filtering**
  - Hardcode the 6 required tables in ImportAsync(): Products, Parts, PlacedSheets, Hardware, Subassemblies, OptimizationResults
  - Add column introspection to ReadTableAsync() to skip BLOB/binary columns (JPegStream, TiffStream, WMFStream, WorkBook, etc.)
  - Use explicit SELECT with only text/numeric columns instead of SELECT *
  - Keep graceful error handling for missing tables

• **Output Path Customization** 
  - Add --output parameter to Program.cs with validation
  - .sqlite extension: output SQLite database directly (skip JSON conversion)
  - .json extension: write JSON to file instead of stdout
  - No --output: maintain current stdout behavior

• **Performance Monitoring**
  - Time each table import and report duration
  - Count and report rows processed per table  
  - Report final file sizes (JSON/SQLite)
  - Add simple progress indicators during import

**Expected Impact:** Eliminating BLOB columns and unnecessary table processing should dramatically improve performance, making incremental import unnecessary.

**Status: Completed** – All Phase 1 optimizations implemented:
- Hardcoded 6 required tables with explicit column filtering
- Binary/BLOB column detection and exclusion (JPegStream, TiffStream, WMFStream, WorkBook, etc.)
- Added --output parameter supporting .sqlite and .json file outputs
- Comprehensive performance monitoring with timing, row counts, and file size reporting
- Enhanced error handling with graceful degradation for missing tables
- Application builds successfully for Windows (win-x86) target platform
